# AI Systems Lab

A learning repo to become an AI systems builder by building small, real systems and documenting what I learn daily.

## How I work
- Daily: one note + one small build + commit + push
- Weekly: review notes, pick next milestone, refactor one project

## Repo map
- docs/        Structured learning notes (my “textbook”)
- notes/daily/ Daily logs (what I learned + commands + mistakes)
- projects/    Small runnable systems (API, RAG, eval, workers)
- src/         Shared reusable code (added when repetition appears)
- tests/       Tests + CI (added once there’s something to test)

## Current focus

- Git/GitHub workflow
- Python tooling
- Building a simple API first
