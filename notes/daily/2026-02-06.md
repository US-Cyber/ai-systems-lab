## What I did
- Created GitHub repo from terminal using gh
- Fixed remote origin URL and pushed
- Set up repo skeleton folders and core files

## Commands I used
- git status
- git remote -v
- git remote set-url origin <url>
- git add .
- git commit -m "..."
- git push
- gh repo create ...

## What I learned
- A remote is just a named URL (origin)
- Repo can exist on GitHub even if local remote wiring fails

## Next
- Start Project 00: CLI config + logging
